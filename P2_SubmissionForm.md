Because of COVID-19, We have conceived the idea about game that would be quiet but fun.
Game ideas were brainstormed from drinking games enjoyed by college students.
Drinking games are usually for ice breaking, and we thought it would be fun because there're fast, intuitive, and various interactions.
At first, we prepared a coaster module that allows friends to drink or play games with pointing function, but after the feedback process, we decided to use one game-pass the bomb coaster to enhance the unity of the module.

This site is what we've searched for coding.
